# RD Challenge

This is a challenge for Full Stack developer position in RD Station company. The full statement and requirements for the challenge may be found in [this markdown file](./STATEMENT.md).

## How to run test cases

The project was developed on `node v14.15.1`. Therefore, the language chosen for the implementation was **JavaScript**. And, as it is a small project which will not require collaboration of others and will not scale, I chose not to upgrade it to use **TypeScript**.

Then, to run the test cases, you will need to run the following 2 commands inside the root directory, to install dependencies and execute the test runner:

```bash
# If using NPM
$ npm install
$ npm test

# If using YARN
$ yarn install
$ yarn test
```
